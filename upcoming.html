                    She was born to carry the storm—if it doesn’t tear her apart first.<br>
                    Reigna Storm has always lived in the shadows—narrating other people’s stories while ignoring the strange visions that haunt her dreams. But when an ancestral power awakens in her blood, she discovers she’s not just a lucid dreamer... she’s the last Sovereign: a hybrid witch with seer blood and a royal fey lineage long thought extinct.<br>
                    Hunted by Nythera, an ancient force of shadow who once shattered the magical Spiral and nearly destroyed the world, Reigna must form a sacred Circle—five magical bondmates who can anchor her rising power before it consumes her.<br>
                    But each bond comes with its own scars. Trust is fragile. And love? Even more dangerous.<br>
                    As their connection deepens and a forgotten war reignites, Reigna realizes that the greatest threat isn’t Nythera—it’s the truth of what she’s becoming.<br>
                    And when a final, unknown bond ignites within her, one thing becomes terrifyingly clear:<br>
                    The storm was never meant to be survived.
